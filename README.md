# IE221 – Team Work Project (SLLN, CLT and Monte Carlo Simulations)

## Project Title and Description
This project is prepared for the IE221 Probability course.  
The main objective of the project is to experimentally verify the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)
and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using Monte Carlo simulation methods.
In addition, Monte Carlo estimation of the number π is implemented as a practical application of SLLN.
